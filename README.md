This repo contains items that are shared by all repositories in the Adobe org.

## Workflow templates

The workflow templates are github actions that you can add to your Adobe org repo. These action templates rely on Adobe org secrets, also privately managed for you.

Instructions on using org workflow templates can be found in github docs.

## Issue & Pull Request Templates

If your repo does not override these templates by providing your own versions, it will receive these templates by default.

Details on creating your own templates can be found in github docs.
